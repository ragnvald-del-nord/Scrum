### Product Backlog
A prioritized list of new product features or capabilities,
which guide its development.

##### Backlog Organization
1. Items in a backlog are ordered by priority from high to low.



|Immediate Action Required|Priority|Position|
|-----|:--:|------------:|
|True |High|Top|
|False|Low |Bottom|

1. Items requiring immediate action 
  * High Priority
  * Top of Product Backlog

1. Items that do not require immediate action 
  - Lower Priority
  - 

2. Items are worked on in order of priority
    * Attempt to ensure that items that were not completed during the iteration 
      have lower priority than the items that were completed.



### Team Characteristics
1. Self-Organizing
2. Cross-Functional


### All work is performed in short, timeboxed iterations
An iteration should result in completed features that can be released, if appropriate.



### Iteration Lifecyle

#### Begining: Planning
The Scrum team plans which high-priority subset of the backlog to create for the upcoming iteration

#### End: Demo
* Team reviews completed features with Stakeholders for feedback
* The feedback that results allows the team to Alter

#### Productively Use Feedback
- What items the team plans to work on next

               New features can be created, prioritized, and inserted into the backlog at an appropriate location.

- How the team plans to work on those items

Product of Iteration
Team should have a potentially shippable product (or increment of a product) that could be released if appropriate.
Whether or not work completed in a sprint is “releasable” is appropriate for release is determined by the team.
