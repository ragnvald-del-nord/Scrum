# Agile 
Begins with the creation of a product backlog

### Product Backlog
A *prioritized* list of *features* and other *capabilities* needed to *develop* a 
*successful product*

#### The Product Backlog should guide development

* Items arranged by priority (High to Low)
* Items are worked on in order

By working on items in order of priority, we ensure that any tickets we can't 
deliver on will be of lower priority than the tickets that were completed.

### Team Characteristics
1. Self-Organizing
2. Cross-Functional

### Iteration
An iteration should result in completed features that could be put into master.

Processes of an interation include 
1. Designing
1. Building 
1. Testing new features or capabilities.


### Iteration Lifecyle

#### Begining: Planning
The Scrum team plans which high-priority subset of the backlog to create for the upcoming iteration

#### End: Demo
* Team reviews completed features with Stakeholders for feedback
* The feedback that results allows the team to Alter

#### Productively Use Feedback
- What items the team plans to work on next

               New features can be created, prioritized, and inserted into the backlog at an appropriate location.

- How the team plans to work on those items

Product of Iteration
Team should have a potentially shippable product (or increment of a product) that could be released if appropriate.
Whether or not work completed in a sprint is “releasable” is appropriate for release is determined by the team.
