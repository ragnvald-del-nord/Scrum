## Agile & Scrum
Strategy for embracing changing requirements during product development.

Scrum teams are Self-Organizing and Cross-Functional.

### Concepts

#### Product Backlog
A prioritized list of new features or capabilities,
which guides the development process.

|Immediate Action|Priority|Position|
|-----|:--:|------------:|
|Required|High|Top|
|Not Required|Low |Bottom|

#### Development Process
All work is performed in timeboxed iterations, and each iteration should produce
shippable features

Items are worked on in order of priority, ensuring that any items that could not 
be worked on, or are only partially complete, have the lowest impact stakeholder satisfaction

|Phase|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|**Planning**|Select high-priority subset of the backlog to bring into upcoming iteration|
|**Sprint**| Items selected during *Sprint Planning* are worked on individually and/or in pair|
|**Demo**|Team receives feedback from stakeholders on completed items|

---

##### The Role of Stakeholder Feedback
Stakeholder Feedback helps us to determine **what to work on next** as well as
**how that work will be completed**
 
Based on Stakeholder Feedback, the team may choose to implement any of the following actions
to better align product development with values of the stakeholders.
* Item Reprioritization
* Item Creation, Prioritization, and Insertion
* Item Archival
